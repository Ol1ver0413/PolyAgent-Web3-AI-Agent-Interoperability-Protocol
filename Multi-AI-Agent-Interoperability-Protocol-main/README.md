This project can analyze market trends, calculate market sentiment by studying changes in main support levels, resistance levels, and trading volume, and provide trading strategies based on the liquidity of relevant currencies. Through the distributed integrated quantitative trading of multi-agent systems, good performance has been achieved in strategy combination, parameter optimization, backtesting analysis, and profit evaluation. Based on the type of order, price triggering conditions and different response strategies can be selected. Through distributed collaboration, intelligent agents are able to handle large and complex tasks, particularly demonstrating robustness and scalability during transactions in web3. We believe that AI agents will bring revolutionary technological changes to automated transactions.
